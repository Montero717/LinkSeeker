# LinkSeeker
This is a simple and interactive Python tool that helps you search the web using Google or DuckDuckGo directly from the command line. It also lets you enter and open URLs manually, fixing any formatting issues automatically. All search results and URLs are saved in text files so you can revisit them anytime.
